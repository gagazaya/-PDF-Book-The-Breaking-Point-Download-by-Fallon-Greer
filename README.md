<p><strong>SYNOPSIS :</strong></p>
<p>Grace Kensington has been my secret crush since we were kids.Though she is definitely all grown up now.Long blonde hair, big blue eyes, and curves that could bring even the toughest hockey player to his knees. She?s the full package, too?smart, funny, and as real as they come.One might go as far as to say perfect. Except for one tiny detail: Grace is my coach?s daughter. And she just walked back into my life. Apparently she?s doing an internship for the team.The last thing I should do is get close to her again. So the plan is to keep my distance.But that plan flies out the window the very first time we run into each other?and I?m naked in the locker room.</p>
